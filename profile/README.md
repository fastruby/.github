## Our Commitment to Open Source

We maintain, co-maintain, and contribute to OSS because we love writing software and sharing it. It's part of our [core
values](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/values/our-values.html) to be "open by default"

To elaborate a bit, we use a lot of open source tools everyday and we truly believe we should give back to the community.

Writing software is time consuming and we as developers get paid to write it. Considering so many developers took their
time to write things we use every day and apps we rely on for our daily jobs, it's only fair that we share our knowledge
and the tools we made ourselves with everyone else, so that others that have the same problems can benefit from our expertise
and contributions.

Also, it's a way to learn and to help others learn what they need to be successful at their jobs.

Finally, and going back to the first sentence: we love to write software and we love sharing it with everyone.
